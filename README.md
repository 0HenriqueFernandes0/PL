## Language Processing

In the Language Processing class, our group built a converter from PUG (https://pugjs.org/) code to HTML. We opted for Python due to its extensive libraries, including regular expressions and yacc. This endeavor proved to be quite challenging, yet it significantly enhanced my understanding of compilers, as well as how to effectively manage large structures in Python.
